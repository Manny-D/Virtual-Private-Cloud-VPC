## Description

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. 

<br>

#### Key Features of AWS VPC:

- <b>Customization</b>: You define your virtual network environment, including selecting your own IP address ranges, creating subnets for specific purposes (like public-facing web servers or private databases), and configuring how traffic flows within your VPC.
- <b>Isolation</b>: Your VPC is logically separated from other user's VPCs, providing an extra layer of security for your resources.
- <b>Connectivity</b>: You control how your resources communicate with each other within the VPC and how they access the internet. VPC offers options like internet gateways and virtual private networks (VPNs) for secure connections.

#### Key Benefits of AWS VPC:

- <b>Enhanced Security</b>: Isolate critical resources within your VPC and control access with security groups and network access controls. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your data and applications.
- <b>Improved Manageability</b>: Simplify network management by creating subnets with specific purposes and controlling traffic flow. This makes it easier to manage complex deployments.
- <b>Flexibility</b>: Design your network environment to meet your specific needs. You can scale your VPC up or down as your requirements change.

In this project, weâ€™ll walk through creating an AWS Account, creating a VPC and launching an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance within that VPC.

##  Create a Virtual Private Cloud

From the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, type <b>vpc</b> and click on <b>VPC</b>. 

![Search VPC](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/6f196379-f8b0-4b52-899e-1c253dc24e15)

Click <b>Create VPC</b> to start the creation wizard.

![Create VPC](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/8a12a68a-b856-45b3-a639-a808c90e9a33)

On the <b>Create VPC</b> page under <b>VPC settings</b>, do the following:

![Create VPC 2a](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/0dfef9f1-1872-477a-a858-394d1227451e)

- <b>Resources to create</b>: (leave the default setting of <b>VPC and more</b>)
- <b>Name tag auto-generation</b>: (leave the default text, <b>project</b>)
- <b>IPv4 CIDR</b>: enter <b>10.0.0.0/24</b>
- <b>Number of Availability Zones (AZs)</b>: change to <b>1</b>
- Leave the other options at their defaults
- Scroll down and click <b>Create VPC</b>

Once successfully created, click on <b>View VPC</b> and your VPC <b>Details</b> page will load:

![Your VPCs (a)](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/808f3cb5-0a80-4e4e-b234-f13850d72fc9)

Now that we've successfully created a VPC, we'll now create an EC2 instance in it.

## Create an Elastic Cloud Compute instance

In the search bar, type <b>ec2</b> and click on <b>EC2</b>.

![Search EC2](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/067326a9-fe4a-450b-902d-c72f1b8b6560)

## Conclusion

This project successfully established a secure foundation for deploying resources in the AWS cloud. We created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with customized settings and launched an EC2 instance within it. This configuration provides isolation and enhanced security for our cloud environment, along with the flexibility to scale and manage resources effectively.
