# Creating a Virtual Private Cloud VPC in AWS

![AWS VPC](https://github.com/Manny-D/Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC/assets/99146530/b95ad2bf-ccb8-4822-a126-c29d9d5e55b5)

## Description

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. 

<br>

Key Features of AWS VPC

- <b>Customization</b>: You define your virtual network environment, including selecting your own IP address ranges, creating subnets for specific purposes (like public-facing web servers or private databases), and configuring how traffic flows within your VPC.
- <b>Isolation</b>: Your VPC is logically separated from other user's VPCs, providing an extra layer of security for your resources.
- <b>Connectivity</b>: You control how your resources communicate with each other within the VPC and how they access the internet. VPC offers options like internet gateways and virtual private networks (VPNs) for secure connections.

Key Benefits of AWS VPC

- <b>Enhanced Security</b>: Isolate critical resources within your VPC and control access with security groups and network access controls. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your data and applications.
- <b>Improved Manageability</b>: Simplify network management by creating subnets with specific purposes and controlling traffic flow. This makes it easier to manage complex deployments.
- <b>Flexibility</b>: Design your network environment to meet your specific needs. You can scale your VPC up or down as your requirements change.
